I set up my CMakeList to put the font into the same directory as the executable: build/output/bin

If for some reason it does not work, you can find my font in the HW1 folder. It is PressStart2P.ttf. It's in the folder main level and also in a folder called fonts.

If my Cmake method doesn't work, copy the font into your build/output/bin folder manually.
